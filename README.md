# Clear
Moved to a new package repository, because the theme now includes a dark theme variation, so using the name Clear Light/Clear White, won't be anywhere optimal.

## Features
- A beautiful, slimmed down user interface, without too much usage of different colors
- Maintains a high contrast value between each component
- Different component is expressed with accent lines
- Focuses at what you are doing
